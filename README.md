# Please read these instructions before starting your website
## Making your website
- Download this github onto your computer and unzip the file folder.
- Double click on the index.html file and open it in notepad++ (if you do not have notepad++ you can download it here: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.3.html .
- Now you can right click your index.html file and open it with notepad++. From here you can edit the file and change what you want.
- If you directly double click the file, you will open it in your default internet browser.
- Now with the HTML and webpage open you can make changes and save them, then refresh the webpage to see what you changed.
- There are many comments in the HTML file that can help you with changing or adding items in your webpage.
- A great resource for helping you on your website is W3 schools: https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp (considering that is what the tamplate you are using is based off of).
- Once you have made all the changes you want to your webpage, you can make a new repository on github (you need to have an account for this).
## Adding your website to github
- When logged into github click the plus icon on the top right of the page and select (new repository).
- When making your new repository, name it the title of your project with underscores instead of spaces. Also initalize it with a README.md file.
- Once the repository is made you can upload your file folder to your repository. make sure you have the master branch selected when you do this so your files are sent there.
- Next you need to go into the settings of your repository and enable github pages using only the master branch.
- Once github pages in enabled you should be able to click the link given to you in the settings to see your website online in all of its glory!
## Getting it all on the Idea Lab projects page
- In order to get your project on the Idea Lab project page you need to transfer ownership of the repository the The Idea Institute.
- You will need to speak with one of the Supervisors of the github account for the Idea Lab so that they can accept the transfer. 
- Once they have recieved ownership they can take one of the images from the project and make a tab for it on the project page.
